/**
 * ReleaseAssetsPanel — thin wrapper around ReleaseAssetUploader for use
 * below each ReleaseRow.
 *
 * Shows existing assets + a drop zone to attach more binaries (Android
 * multi-arch, Electron multi-OS, RN bundle). After the new release flow
 * (commit for task #30), most uploads happen in the dialog itself; this
 * panel is still useful for late additions ("oh I forgot arm64").
