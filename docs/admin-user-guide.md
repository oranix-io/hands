# Quiver Admin User Guide

Status: **draft v1** (X.1.4 — cross-cutting docs)
Audience: humans and agents operating the Quiver admin UI at `https://quiver-worker.artin.workers.dev/`

---

## 1. Overview

Quiver is an open-source APK / desktop-app / OTA-bundle distribution platform. The admin UI is the operator console for managing apps, versions, releases, channels, organizations, and teams.

**URL**: `https://quiver-worker.artin.workers.dev/`

**Auth**: Login with Raft. Sign in with your Raft account. Humans and agents are both first-class principals — an agent login lands in the same org as the human owner of the same Raft server.

**Stack**:
- Single-page React app (Vite + Tailwind + TanStack Query)
- Routes: `/`, `/settings`, `/apps/:appId/*`, `/orgs/:orgId`, `/invites/:token`
- All data flows through `worker/src/index.ts` Hono handlers; admin endpoints guarded by per-route role middleware (RBAC).

---

## 2. Caveats (as of 2026-06-28)

- **Invites do NOT send email yet.** The backend returns an `invite_url` (e.g. `https://quiver-worker.artin.workers.dev/invites/<uuid>`); the admin UI copies it to your clipboard on create. You'll need to share the URL manually (Slack DM, email, etc.). Email delivery is a P5.5 / P5.6 follow-up.
- **Duplicate pending invite returns 409.** Same email + same org + status=pending → conflict. Resend the existing one or wait for it to expire (7-day TTL).
- **App invite / member add ensures the principal is at least an org viewer.** Adding someone to an app who isn't in the org yet fails with 403/404 — invite them to the org first.
- **Last org owner cannot be removed or demoted.** If you try to remove the last owner, you get 409. Promote another member to owner first.
- **RBAC is per-route, not per-field.** Some endpoints reject unauthorized access; no per-field hiding.

## 3. Page-by-page

### 3.1 Top bar (always visible)

```
[ quiver ] [ Apps ] [ Org  owner ] [ Settings ]         alice@acme.com  [agent]  [avatar]  Logout
```

- **Org** link goes to `/orgs/<your-org-id>` (or `/orgs/placeholder` before first login). The role chip next to "Org" shows your current org role (owner=purple, admin=blue, others=gray).
- If `account.principal_type === 'agent'`, an **agent** badge is shown next to your display name.

### 3.2 `/` Apps list

Lists all apps visible to your current org. Each row shows:

- App name + "📦 Archived" badge if archived
- "⚠ other org" badge if `app.org_id` doesn't match your current org (defensive — shouldn't happen in v1)
- Slug (monospace)
- Description (1-2 line preview)
- Three stat badges: 📦 N product types, 🏷️ N release types, 🚀 N channels
- Platform badge (e.g. `android`, `ios`)
- "Show archived" toggle above the list with count
- "+ New app" → opens the 3-step App Creation Wizard

**App Creation Wizard** (3 steps):

1. **Basics** — name (required), slug (auto-generated kebab-case from name, editable), description (optional)
2. **Product types** — checklist of what we ship:
   - Android APK (default checked)
   - Electron desktop app (with sub-picker for supported platforms: darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, win32-x64, win32-arm64)
   - React Native OTA bundle
   - iOS IPA
   - CLI binary
   - "Add custom product type"
3. **Release types** — review seeded defaults (stable/rc/beta/internal with colors) + add custom

On save: creates the app + seeds default `product_types` + default `release_types` (stable/rc/beta/internal with colors) + default channels (production/beta/internal with `bundle_id` overrides for parallel install).

### 3.3 `/apps/:appId` App detail (Overview tab)

Default route. Shows:
- App name + platform badge + slug + "📦 Archived" badge if archived
- 3 quick links: "View audit log →", "Manage publishing →", "Manage access →"
- **Versions section** (default tab content):
  - Each version row: name (code) + channel + enabled/disabled badge + ⚠ force / scheduled badges
  - "Upload APK" button (only enabled when channels exist)
  - "+ New channel" button → CreateChannelDialog (name/slug + optional bundle_id/password/git_url)
  - Each channel rendered as a `ChannelRow` card with Edit button → EditChannelDialog (change name, bundle_id, password, git_url, 2-step delete confirm with ref-check)
- **Operations section** (embed): recent parse/upload/publish operations with retry/delete actions

### 3.4 App context nav (under the top bar)

```
App context:  [Versions]  [Publish]  [Builds]  [Releases]  [Access]  [Audit]
```

Each link navigates to a sub-route under `/apps/:appId/`.

### 3.5 `/apps/:appId/publish` Publishing dashboard

Lists all versions for the app with stats (Total / Enabled / Channels / Total size). Search by version, package, hash. Filter by channel. Each `PublishRow` shows:
- Version name (code) + channel badge + enabled/disabled badge
- Package name + size + date
- SHA-256 prefix
- Actions: **Move** (re-route to a different channel) / **Disable** (toggle `enabled=0`) / **Force** (toggle `should_force_update=1`)

### 3.6 `/apps/:appId/builds` Builds tab

List of build artifacts. Each row: version (code) + product_type badge + release_type (colored chip) + channel + status badge (pending/building/succeeded/failed/smoke_testing/smoke_test_passed/smoke_test_failed) + ⚠ force badge + scheduled badge + date.

Click "Show assets" to expand an `BuildAssetList` table: platform / arch / variant / filetype / size / sha256 prefix.

Click "Prepare release" to open `PrepareReleaseDialog`:
- Radio: full / platform / ip_range scope
- If platform: comma-separated platforms (e.g. `darwin-arm64,darwin-x64,linux-x64`)
- If ip_range: comma-separated CIDR (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16`)
- Click "Release" → `POST /api/apps/:appId/releases` with built scopes
- Backend defaults to `full/all` if scopes omitted

### 3.7 `/apps/:appId/releases` Releases tab

List of live releases. Stats cards: Total / Active / Superseded / Channels. Filter by channel and status. Each `ReleaseRow`:
- Status badge (active=green, superseded=gray, rolled_back=yellow, cancelled=red)
- Release type colored chip
- Channel + product type
- full/scoped badge + ⚠ force badge + rollout % badge
- Build ID hash
- Changelog (collapsible)
- Actions on active releases: **Bump rollout** (slider 0-100% → `POST /bump-rollout`), **Force** / **Unforce** (`POST /force-update`), **Roll back** (creates a new release pointing to the current build)
- "Show detail" → loads `getRelease` → shows build info + asset count + scope table (type/value pairs)

### 3.8 `/apps/:appId/access` App access tab

Per-app member management. Shows current principal's `org_role` + a guard ("can manage members" if owner/admin).

- **AppMemberList** — `GET /api/apps/:appId/members`:
  - Columns: principal (display name + provider_subject prefix) / type (human/agent) / app_role (admin/publisher/viewer dropdown for owner/admin except self) / joined date / Remove (owner/admin, except self, confirm)
- **AddAppMemberForm** — `POST /api/apps/:appId/members`:
  - Fetches `listOrgMembers`, filters out members already on this app
  - Select principal + role (admin/publisher/viewer) + Add button
  - Empty state: "All org members are already on this app."
  - Hint: "Direct add — principal must already be an org member. For inviting new people, use the Org settings → Invites tab."

### 3.9 `/apps/:appId/audit` Audit log

Per-app audit log (`audit_logs WHERE app_id = ?`). Columns: when / actor (with agent badge) / app id / action / payload (truncated JSON). 100 most recent entries.

### 3.10 `/orgs/:orgId` Org settings (4 tabs)

**Access**: org owner / admin only (per-route RBAC). The org_id in the URL must match your current org; otherwise a warning banner shows.

**Tabs**:
- **General** — static info from `/api/auth/me`: external_provider, server_id, server_slug, principal_type, org_id, your org_role (colored), server_role
- **Members** — `GET /api/orgs/:orgId/members`:
  - Columns: principal / type (agent badge) / org_role dropdown (owner/admin/member/viewer, owner/admin only, excludes self) / joined date / Remove (owner/admin only, confirm)
- **Invites** — `GET /api/orgs/:orgId/invites`:
  - Columns: email / role / status badge (pending/accepted/revoked/expired) / expires / Resend (admin) / Revoke (admin, confirm)
  - "+ Invite member" button → modal: email (required, lowercased) + role (member/viewer) + optional message
  - On create: `POST /api/orgs/:orgId/invites` returns `invite_url`; admin UI copies to clipboard + shows toast with URL
- **Audit** — `GET /api/orgs/:orgId/audit-logs`:
  - 100 most recent entries; org-scoped (cross-app aggregation)
  - Columns: when / actor (agent badge) / app id / action / payload

### 3.11 `/invites/:token` Accept invite (public)

No auth required to view. If you're not signed in, you see "Sign in with Raft to accept" button (preserves return_to so you bounce back after OAuth). If signed in, you see "Accept invite" button which calls `POST /api/invites/:token/accept` and navigates to the app or org dashboard.

States:
- `pending` — accept button
- `accepted` — "✓ You've already accepted this invite."
- `expired` — red message, ask inviter for new one
- `revoked` — red message, ask inviter

### 3.12 `/settings` Settings

Top card: "Current account" — display name + principal_type (with agent badge) + server + server_role + org_id + your org_role (colored) + hint to ask owner/admin to change role.

Below: static infrastructure info (Raft callback URL, Cloudflare account, D1 db, R2 bucket, container image).

## 4. Common workflows

### 4.1 Publish a new Android build

1. Navigate to the app → Overview tab.
2. Click "Upload APK" → 4-step wizard:
   - **Step 1 Target**: select channel (e.g. `production`), product_type (default `android-apk`), release_type (e.g. `stable`)
   - **Step 2 File**: pick the .apk; container parses it; metadata shown inline (package, version, signature, minSdk, size, SHA-256)
   - **Step 3 Details**: confirm version name + code (auto-filled from parsed metadata), changelog markdown, should_force_update checkbox, availability datetime, provenance (git commit / branch / CI URL / source: web/cli/ci)
   - **Step 4 Review**: summary card → "Publish to production" button
3. After publish: app appears on next "Apps list" refresh; version visible in Versions section; release created in Releases tab (active status)

### 4.2 Roll back a bad release

1. Go to `/apps/:appId/releases`.
2. Find the bad active release.
3. Click "Roll back" → `POST /api/releases/:id/rollback` creates a new active release pointing to the **previous build** (or to a `build_id` you specify).
4. Old active release is now `superseded`.

### 4.3 Bump rollout percentage for a staged release

1. `/apps/:appId/releases` → find the active release.
2. Click "Bump rollout" → slider appears.
3. Drag to target % (0-100, step 5) → click "Set" → `POST /bump-rollout`.

### 4.4 Force update (critical fix)

1. `/apps/:appId/releases` → active release → click "Force" → `POST /force-update`.
2. All clients must install on next check; no "skip" option.
3. Unforce via "Unforce" button when fixed.

### 4.5 Add a new team member to your org

1. `/orgs/<your-org>` → Invites tab → "+ Invite member".
2. Enter their email (e.g. `bob@acme.com`).
3. Pick role: `member` (humans default) or `viewer` (agents / read-only).
4. Optional message.
5. Click "Create invite" → URL copied to clipboard.
6. Share the URL with the invitee (manually, since email delivery isn't wired yet — see Caveats §2).
7. They open the URL → `/invites/<token>` → "Sign in with Raft to accept" → they're in.
8. To promote them to admin/owner: Members tab → change role dropdown.

### 4.6 Add a new human to a specific app (not the whole org)

1. They need to be in your org first → invite via Org settings → Invites (steps above).
2. Once they're an org member: `/apps/:appId/access` → "Add app member" → select their name from the dropdown → pick role (`admin`/`publisher`/`viewer`) → Add.

### 4.7 Promote an agent to publisher or admin

Same flow as humans. Agents default to `org_role='viewer'` and `app_role='viewer'`. In Org settings → Members, change their role via the dropdown (you need to be owner/admin to do this).

### 4.8 Archive an app (soft delete)

(If your org allows it; v1 only ships the schema — archive UI is being built.) Future: `/apps/:appId` → Settings → "Archive" toggle.

## 5. Roles reference

| Role | Scope | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| `org:owner` | Org | Everything: manage members, manage invites, transfer ownership (v2), archive org, manage all apps in org |
| `org:admin` | Org | Manage members + invites, edit most app settings; can't delete last owner |
| `org:member` | Org | Read members + invites; view audit log |
| `org:viewer` | Org | Read members; no invite management |
| `app:admin` | App | Manage app members, edit app settings, delete app |
| `app:publisher` | App | Upload builds, create releases, edit release metadata |
| `app:viewer` | App | Read builds/releases; no edits |

**Effective role** for a (account, app) is `MAX(org_role, app_role)`. See `account-org-invite.md` §5.2 for the full role matrix.

## 6. Keyboard shortcuts

(none yet — v2 candidate)

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### "500 Internal Server Error" with no body

- Check the Worker's `wrangler tail` for stack trace.
- Most common cause: `D1_ERROR: ...` — check if the migration you need is applied (`npx wrangler d1 migrations list quiver-db --remote`).
- Look at the corresponding audit log row (`/apps/:appId/audit` or `/orgs/:orgId/audit`) for the `error` field.

### "404 not found" for a newly-created app

- Quiver caches list endpoints. Wait ~5s for the cache to expire, or hard-refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R).

### "401 unauthorized" on an admin endpoint

- The session cookie may have expired (14-day TTL by default; check `/settings` → "current account" shows you a valid session).
- Re-login at `/api/auth/login`.

### "403 forbidden" on an edit action

- Your current role doesn't allow the action. The UI usually shows a warning — check the page for `⚠ owner / admin required`.

### Invite "expired" but you just created it

- Check the clock on the server vs the URL you used. The 7-day TTL is computed at server time. If your local clock is way off, the visible "expires" date may be misleading.

## 8. Future (P5.5 / P5.6 / Phase 3 / Phase 4)

- Agent audit log per-org detail
- Org ownership transfer
- Multi-org switcher (top-bar dropdown)
- Scheduled release at exact datetime
- Smoke test integration (real macOS / Windows / Linux VMs)
- App transfer between orgs
- Webhook delivery with retry-on-failure queue
- CLI: `@oranix/quiver-cli` npm package for CI integration (see `cli-reference.md`)
