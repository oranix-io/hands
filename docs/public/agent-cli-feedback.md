# Agent CLI: feedback & crash triage

A task-focused walkthrough for agents that need to **read and triage feedback
and crash tickets** from the command line. For the broader auth model and
release/share operations, see the [Agent Guide](/docs/agent-guide/); for the
full command surface, the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference/).

## Choose the right auth surface

Hands supports both Raft manifest actions and the local CLI, but their sessions
are intentionally separate:

- `raft integration invoke` uses the session held by Raft Agent Login and is
  the preferred surface for interactive agent/admin actions.
- `@botiverse/hands-cli` requires an explicit Hands bearer/deploy token and is
  the preferred surface for CI and repeatable release scripts.

An integration login is not exported to the CLI through environment
variables. Do not scrape cookies or callback handoffs to bridge the two.

## 1. Get a CLI token

For app-scoped automation, an admin can create a deploy token through the
Hands console or the Raft integration:

```bash
raft integration login --service hands-4cc7a2
raft integration invoke --service hands-4cc7a2 \
  --action create-deploy-token \
  --param app_id=<app-uuid> \
  --data-json '{"name":"agent-cli","app_role":"publisher"}' \
  --json
```

Store the one-time raw token in a private secret manager, then export it for
the CLI:

```bash
export HANDS_BEARER_TOKEN=<deploy-token>
```

Use a `viewer` token for read-only triage and `publisher` only when the script
must upload or mutate releases. Revoke and replace any token whose initial
secret-store write fails.

## 2. Run the CLI

No global install needed:

```bash
npm exec --package @botiverse/hands-cli -- hands whoami
```

(Pin a version with `@botiverse/hands-cli@0.3.2` if you want reproducibility.)
Every command below takes `--json` for scripting.

## Triage commands

The first argument is the **app slug** (or id), e.g. `raft-android`.

```bash
# List tickets, newest first (filterable)
hands feedback list raft-android --status open --kind crash
hands feedback list raft-android --kind bug

# Show one ticket: description, device context, attachments, comments.
# Use the full UUID from the submitted ticket response/reference.
hands feedback show raft-android 389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

# Triage: change status and/or (re)assign
hands feedback update raft-android 389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --status in_progress --assignee me
hands feedback update raft-android 389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --status resolved
hands feedback update raft-android 389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --assignee none   # unassign

# Leave an internal comment (also where auto-retrace/symbolication land)
hands feedback comment raft-android 389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 "reproduced on SGT-AL10; fix in progress"
```

Status flow: `open → in_progress → resolved → closed`. Assignee is
independent of status.

## Quick lookup by feedback id

When a user pastes a Hands feedback id, first identify the app slug. For
Raft Android/mobile, that slug is normally `raft-android`.

New Hands feedback responses include the full UUID in both `id` and the
copyable `reference` field, for example:

```text
raft-android · 1.0.4 (1000400) · ticket 389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

Use that UUID directly:

```bash
TICKET_ID=389d855b-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
APP=raft-android

hands feedback show "$APP" "$TICKET_ID"
```

The CLI now prints full UUIDs in human output. You can also pass a **short id
or any unique prefix** — the feedback read/detail/attachment endpoints resolve
it to the full ticket automatically (an ambiguous prefix returns `409`; use a
longer prefix or the full UUID):

```bash
hands feedback show raft-android 389d855b   # 8-char short id works
```

The `show` output is the first place to check for diagnostics: it includes
the user message, version/channel, device context, comments, and all
attachment ids. Crash deobfuscation/symbolication output is appended as an
internal comment when mapping/symbol assets exist.

For scripts, keep the raw JSON:

```bash
hands feedback show "$APP" "$TICKET_ID" --json > ticket.json
```

## Crashes

Crash tickets (`--kind crash`) carry a grouping **signature** (exception
class + top frame). When the build's `mapping.txt` (Java/R8) or
`native-symbols` archive was uploaded, an auto-deobfuscated / symbolicated
stack is appended as an internal comment — visible in `feedback show`. To
aggregate by signature across a fleet, call the API directly:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $QUIVER_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  https://hands.build/api/apps/<appId>/feedback/crash-groups
```

## Attachments (diagnostics zips, logs)

`feedback show` lists each attachment's id, filename, and size. Download one
with the CLI (accepts a slug and a short/prefix ticket id):

```bash
hands feedback download-attachment raft-android 389d855b <attachmentId>
# → Saved 445539 bytes to slock-feedback-....zip   (use -o to choose the path)
```

Hands saves the **raw bytes as-is** — it does not unzip or interpret the
contents. Hands does not define the files inside an app's diagnostics archive;
it stores and serves the attachment, and the producing app owns the log format
and archive layout (how to open a given app's zip is documented in that app's
repo, not here).

The same downloads and ticket detail can also be fetched directly via REST
(the API path uses the app **UUID**, not the slug):

```bash
APP_ID="$(hands apps get "$APP" --json \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $QUIVER_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  "https://hands.build/api/apps/$APP_ID/feedback/$TICKET_ID"                       # ticket detail
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $QUIVER_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  "https://hands.build/api/apps/$APP_ID/feedback/$TICKET_ID/attachments/<attachmentId>" \
  -o diagnostics.zip                                                                     # raw attachment
```

## Other environment knobs

- `QUIVER_API` — point the CLI at a non-production Worker (defaults to the
  production origin).
- `--json` — machine-readable output on every command, for agents that parse
  results.
