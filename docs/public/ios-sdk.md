# iOS SDK

`Quiver` is the iOS SDK for Quiver: in-app **feedback tickets** and
store-then-send **crash reporting** posted to a Quiver server's public
feedback endpoint. Objective-C, no dependencies, iOS 14.1+.

## Install (CocoaPods, via git)

```ruby
pod 'Quiver', :git => 'https://github.com/oranix-io/quiver.git', :tag => 'ios-v0.1.3'
```

## Configure & start

All configuration is runtime parameters — the SDK ships nothing
app-specific. Get the client key from your app's **Settings** tab in the
Quiver console (Sentry-DSN model: it identifies the app and ships in the
bundle; rotate it from the console if it leaks).

```swift
import Quiver

Quiver.install(with: QuiverConfig(
    baseUrl: "https://quiver.example.com",
    appSlug: "my-app",
    channel: "main",          // Quiver release-channel routing field
    clientKey: "qk_…"
))
```

`install(with:)` installs the crash handlers and uploads any pending crash
reports a few seconds after launch. Call it as early as possible (app init).

## Feedback

```swift
Quiver.submitFeedback(
    "Feed doesn't refresh after login.",
    kind: "bug",                      // "feedback" | "bug" | "crash"
    attachmentPaths: [logFilePath],   // up to 3 files, 10 MB each
    extras: nil
) { ticketId, error in … }
```

Device metadata (version, model, OS, arch, locale, per-install device id) is
attached automatically.

## Crash reporting

- Uncaught `NSException`s: full `callStackSymbols` plus a signature sidecar.
- Fatal signals (SIGABRT/SEGV/BUS/ILL/FPE/TRAP): the guaranteed record is
  written with async-signal-safe calls only; stack capture runs last as
  best-effort.
- Reports upload as `kind=crash` tickets on the next launch and are grouped
  by signature server-side; retention cap 5 pending reports on disk.

Known v1 gaps: no all-threads dump, no Mach exception handling, no dSYM
symbolication server-side yet.

## Notes

- The client key (`qk_…`) authenticates feedback/crash submissions. It ships
  inside the app bundle (Sentry-DSN model — app identifier, not a user
  secret); it is never logged or included in diagnostics exports.
- The device id is a random UUID in `NSUserDefaults`, not a hardware id; it
  resets on reinstall.
